General Approach: 

1. For every python file in the relevant directory, we represented it as a node and each edge to the project nodes point to a dependancy! 
2. We ensured the graph was visually understandable to a user by placing each '*.py" 
file away from eachother by a certain distance by placing them on seperate ends of the image.

Future Improvements: 

1. For all circular dependancies, display the edges with a a red color to highlight vulnerabilities.
2. Would want to visualize the directory structure to make it easy for user to navigate through the code base
3. We would want to differentiate libraries, files, and directories with colors!
4. We believe it would be REALLY cool to make the size of a node identify how dependant a file is!
